# Example React App with unit and integration tests
> This is my base config for testing [react](https://reactjs.org/) application with [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) module bundler with [redux](https://redux.js.org/) library and [redux-thunk](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk) middleware.
## Quick Start
> For testing, I use [jest](https://jestjs.io/) framework and [enzyme](https://enzymejs.github.io/enzyme/) library.

> For testing component properties, I use [check-prop-types](https://github.com/ratehub/check-prop-types) library.

> For mock HTTP requests, I use the [moxios](https://github.com/axios/moxios) library.
